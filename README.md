The BeMoBIL Pipeline is an open-source MATLAB toolbox for fully automatic, transparent, and replicable processing and visualization of mobile brain/body imaging and other EEG data. It includes wrappers for EEGLAB functions, the use of additional EEGLAB plugins, and comes with additional functionalities. 

All parameters are configurable in a central script and everything is stored in the EEG.etc struct. Additionally, analytics plots are generated for each step.
